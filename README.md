# CinnibarOS
## *A Typescript based operative system for screeps*

This is the basis for my screeps AI, based on [the typescript starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter). It contains no actual functionality, remaining open for you to use as you wish. Documentation is currently very sparse, but I intend to add more as time goes on.

#### Setup
To set this up follow the instructions in the Typescript Starter readme. Note that this code will be be uploaded to the "cinnbar" branch so as to preserve any old code you may wish to keep.

#### Contributing
You are free to contribute if you wish. I make no promises about whether it get's pulled in but whatever, knock yourself out.
